CMPE 138 - Professor Kong Li

The application is written in C++ via Visual Studio IDE after adding necessary libraries and connector components to accommodate the relationship between mysql database engine and the console application. The specific version of components used in this project is as follow: MySQL Workbench 8.0CE, MySQL server 8.0, MySQL Connector C++ 1.1.12, Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017 Version 15.9.11

All viewers of this repository are free take inspiration from it, but do note that if you intend to plagerize this code (which will be incredibly easy to find out to anyone who knows how to use Google) Kong Li himself will teleport behind you, chuckle softly saying "nothing personal kid", and then hit you over the head with a shovel.
